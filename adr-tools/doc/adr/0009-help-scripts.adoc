Accepted

Amends link:0005-help-comments.adoc[5. Help comments]

=== Context

Currently help text is generated by extracting specially formatted
comments from the top of the command script.

This makes it easy for developers of the tool: documentation and code is
all in one place.

But, it means that help text cannot include calculated values, such as
the location of files.

=== Decision

Where necessary, help text can be generated by a script.

The script will be called __adr_help___

=== Consequences

Help scripts can include helper scripts to locate files, giving more
accurate instructions to the user that reflect how the tool is deployed
in their environment.
